The assets are the property of Unity Technologies and the only substantial
modification was applied to `Scavengers_SpriteSheet.png` (not included) which
was cut into `32x32` pixel tiles. In all folders of this tutorial these are
found under the `Assets` folder and the process is explained in the
[first chapter of the tutorial series, introduction & project set-up](https://razvanc-r.gitlab.io/posts/2016/09/14/s01-godot-roguelike_introduction-project-set-up/).
